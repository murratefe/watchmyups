## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for helping to keep this project secure!

We use **GitHub Security Advisories** to handle all security vulnerability reports confidentially.

If you discover a security issue, please report it **only via GitHub Security Advisories** by following these steps:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/murratefe/watchmyups/security) of this repository.
2. Click on **"Security Advisories"**.
3. Create a new security advisory to submit your report privately.

Please **do not open public issues or send emails for security reports**, to ensure responsible disclosure and to protect users.

### What to expect after reporting

- We will acknowledge your report within a few business days.  
- We will work on a fix and notify you of progress via GitHub advisories.  
- Once fixed, a security update will be released, and the advisory will be published publicly.

Thank you for helping us improve the security of this project!
